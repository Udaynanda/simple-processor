# CPU Simulator with Assembler
CS256 Course project - done under the guidance of Dr.Anirban Sengupta 
Developed a simple CPU simulator with an assembler that translates assembly code into machine code for execution. The CPU simulation includes instruction handling, memory management, and register operations. It processes arithmetic, logical, and control flow instructions using a fetch-decode-execute cycle. This project provides a foundational understanding of CPU architecture and assembly language programming.
